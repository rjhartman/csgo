# CS:GO Settings

Contains the autoexec I use for CS:GO, which configures viewmodel/connection settings for highest headshot chance.

## Installation

1. Open command prompt
2. Run `install.bat`:

   ```
   C:\csgo>install.bat
   Copying autoexec.cfg to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg".
           1 file(s) copied.
   ```

3. Profit
